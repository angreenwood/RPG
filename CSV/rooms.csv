Outside;Outside;You stand before a giant Tavern. It's large structure casts a shadow over the land around you. Lush trees stand next to the structure only to be dwarfed by it's massive size. The stonework is impressive and it appears to have been the product of master craftsman. You begin to wonder what an inn of this quality is doing all the way out here in the reaches of the land. Perhaps you should venture in and explore further?;north Tavern
Tavern;Tavern Entrance;You're in a cozy tavern warmed by an open fire. The smell of fresh dinner permiates the air. From somewhere upstairs you can hear the somber strums of a lute. You can't help but think to yourself how long its been since you've been inside such a place. The wilderness really has left it's mark on you! Perhaps you should search for a fire to bring life back into your travelled body.; south Outside north Hallway
Hallway;Hallway;You enter a long hallway. The fresh smell of firewood envelopes the area. Lavish paintings hug the wall, with stone braziers alternating each one. At the end of the hallway you can see a glowing light. As you walk further down the hall you can definitely hear the crack and sputter of what you would guess to be a very large fireplace room. Especially if it's casting this much heat into other rooms.;south Tavern west Fireplace north Hall_to_upstairs 
Fireplace;Fireplace;You stand before a grand fireplace. Marble work seems to almost grow from the floors around this behemoth. Many urns line the top mantle above the opening. As you watch the flames, you begin to notice faces dancing in the fire. You jump back in a startle!;east Hallway north Washroom
Washroom;Fart Zone;You stand here afraid for your life. The smell alone was enough to put you on your heels. You can't help but wonder who this Beth is and what she has been eating. As you start to investigate further, you catch yourself and stop further inspection. Sometimes not knowing is the best decision.;east Hallway south Fireplace
